			We are Cork Institute of Technology's Offical Cycle Ball Club we are based on C.I.T's campus with training every week often in the sports hall but we try to hold the training outside when every we get a chance.

			If you are unfamliar with cycle ball, You might be asking yourself what is Cycle Ball? Well to put it simply It's literally football played on bikes.
			Traditionally it is called RadBall
		</p>
		<h2>The Game</h2>
		<p>
			The rules are simple get the ball into the opposing teams goal without using your hands or feet only using your bike.<br>
			The Teams usally consist of two players on each team due to the nature of the game,
			however there are 5 player and 6 player versions.
		</p>
		<h2>History of Cycle Ball</h2>
		<p>
			The sport was introduced in 1893 by a German-American, Nicholas Edward Kaufmann. Its first world championships were in 1929.<br>
			Cycle ball is popular in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Russia and Switzerland. <br>
			The most successful players were the Pospíšil brothers of Czechoslovakia, world champions 20 times between 1965 and 1988.
		</p>
		<h3>Championships</h3>
		<p>
			There aren't many noteable Championships for cycle ball,<br>
			The largest one is UCI Indoor Cycling World Championships were there is a tournament of cycle ball. The UCI awards a gold medal and a rainbow jersey to the winner. Silver and bronze medals are awarded to the second and third place contestants.<br>
			World champions wear their rainbow jersey until the following year's championship, but they may wear it only in the type of event in which they won it.
		</p>
		<h3>C.I.T Cycle Ball</h3>
		<p>
			At the moment we are a relitively small club due to the fact many people are unaware of how great cycle ball is. however we are a of a suitable size to enter cycle ball leagues around Ireland if you are intrested in competing on a national level. <BR>
